StreamTitle

  StreamTitle is a little tool that I made so that I can change my stream
  information from the command line. And if you configure it properly, so it
  can for you.

How to configure

    Go to the Twitch Developer Console at https://dev.twitch.tv/console and
    create a new application. The OAuth redirection URL must be set to
    http://localhost:9300/st-callback but aside from that, you can call the
    application whatever you want. Grab the client ID and the client secret.

    Run StreamTitle using the `-env` parameter to print the location to the
    config file. You can use this to know where to place the configuration
    variables:

        nano "$(streamtitle -env)"

    Use the following template, but fill the variables according to the guide
    below:

        CLIENT_ID=
        CLIENT_SECRET=

    * CLIENT_ID: the client ID you got from the application
    * CLIENT_SECRET: the client secret you got from the application

    Something like:

        CLIENT_ID=xxxxxxxxx
        CLIENT_SECRET=yyyyyyyyyy

How to use

    On first start, or if the refresh token expires or gets invalidated, you
    will be asked to login again or authorize the application. It will print an
    URL, open it on your browser and authorize the application.

    To test the token connection, you can print your stream information:

        streamtitle -verbose

        Current stream information:
               Title: Golang development
                Game: 1469308723
            Language: en
                Tags: [Golang Terminal Development]

    You can use one or many flags to change the stream information. You might
    need to pass the values in quotes to prevent weird things from happening.

    * `-title`: set the new stream title: `streamtitle -title "cooking pasta"`
    * `-game`: set the stream category; you need the category ID (there are
      Google searches that can tell you the category ID): `streamtitle -game
      509670`
    * `-lang`: set the stream language; use two character ISO code:
      `streamtitle -lang es`
    * `-tags`: set the stream tags; provide up to ten alphanumerical strings
      separated by commas, no spaces: `streamtitle -tags SafeSpace,Role,Retro`

    If you also provide the `-verbose` flag, you will see the old and the new
    stream information, in case you want to save it for later (restoring old
    settings, maybe?)

    A more complete example:

        streamtitle -verbose -title "cooking pasta" -game 509670 -lang en
