StreamTitle

  StreamTitle is a little tool that I made so that I can change my stream
  information from the command line. And if you configure it properly, so it
  can for you.

Breaking changes

    If you previously stored the credentials in a file called .StreamTitle.env,
    you will have to migrate the file to a new file called config.toml, as
    described below.

    This change was made to accomodate for additional options in the future.
    Mainly profiles.

How to configure

    Go to the Twitch Developer Console at https://dev.twitch.tv/console and
    create a new application. The OAuth redirection URL must be set to
    http://localhost:9300/st-callback but aside from that, you can call the
    application whatever you want. Grab the client ID and the client secret.

    Create a file in $XDG_CONFIG_DIR/StreamTitle/config.toml with the
    following two lines, having the values that are described below.
    On macOS, the config.toml configuration file has to be created in
    ~/Library/Application Support/StreamTitle/config.toml.

        client_id = 'x'     # the client ID you got from the application
        client_secret = 'x' # the client secret you got from the application

How to use

    On first start, or if the refresh token expires or gets invalidated, you
    will be asked to login again or authorize the application. It will print an
    URL, open it on your browser and authorize the application.

    To test the token connection, you can print your stream information
    with the -current flag.

        streamtitle -current

        Current stream information:
               Title: Golang development
                Game: 1469308723
            Language: en
                Tags: [Golang Terminal Development]

    You can use one or many flags to change the stream information. You might
    need to pass the values in quotes to prevent weird things from happening.

    * `-title`: set the new stream title: `streamtitle -title "cooking pasta"`
    * `-game`: set the stream category; you need the category ID (there are
      Google searches that can tell you the category ID): `streamtitle -game
      509670`
    * `-lang`: set the stream language; use two character ISO code:
      `streamtitle -lang es`
    * `-tags`: set the stream tags; provide up to ten alphanumerical strings
      separated by commas, no spaces: `streamtitle -tags SafeSpace,Role,Retro`

    A more complete example:

        streamtitle -title "cooking pasta" -game 509670 -lang en
