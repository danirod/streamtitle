News file for StreamTitle.

* StreamTitle 1.0.12 (2024-02-18)

** Breaking change: new configuration file format and location

    The existing .StreamTitle.env file will be ignored starting with
    this version.

    The configuration file has migrated to a new file called
    config.toml, which has to be placed in the following location:

    - $HOME/Library/Application Support/StreamTitle/config.toml for
      macOS.

    - %LOCALAPPDATA%\StreamTitle\config.toml for Microsoft Windows.

    - $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/StreamTitle/config.toml for GNU/Linux and other
      unices.

    As described in the README, the config file should contain at
    least the client ID and the client secret for the Twitch
    application that will manage the connection with the API.

    The refresh token is not stored in the config file
    anymore. Instead, it will use from now on a separate file that
    lives in $XDG_STATE_HOME/StreamTitle/credentials.toml for
    GNU/Linux and other unices but macOS, and on the same directory as
    config.toml for macOS and Microsoft Windows.

** Breaking change: new behaviour for the -verbose flag

    Previously, the "-verbose" flag would print the existing stream
    information, and if a change was requested, it would print the new
    stream information.

    This behaviour has been removed and the current stream information
    can be presented with the new "-current" flag. This flag causes
    StreamTitle to fetch the remote information, display it and exit.

    The "-verbose" flag is now used for displaying additional log
    messages as StreamTitle does its stuff.

** Profiles

    It is now possible to store profiles in the configuration
    file. Profiles make easy to reuse the same settings. For instance,
    if a channel broadcasts different shows but each show uses the
    same tags, category and title, it is now possible to store the
    channel information for each show in a profile, and use the new
    "-profile" flag to change all the stored settings at once.

    Profiles do not require to set all the stream information in the
    configuration file. In fact, they can omit any key and the
    previous value for that setting will be kept when changing the
    channel information into a profile.

    It is posisble to combine the new profile flag with the existing
    flags to set the title, tags and similar. For instance, the
    profile can store the category and tags, but let the stream
    provide the new title each time via the "-title" parameter.

    Initial release made available online. It can be used to get the
